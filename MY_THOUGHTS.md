I'll use this document to write down my thoughts behind the changes in each commit:

### Commit 1: Adding unit tests.
Basic TDD practice; To make sure none of my future changes break the existing functionality, I've added exhaustive unit tests with 100% coverage. With every future change I make, I'll run the tests to make sure everything still works as expected.
